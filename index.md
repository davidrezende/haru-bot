## About

Create, customize and manage annotations. You have access to your notes on any server the bot is also a part of.

Use your creativity with notes, create game cards, your diary or simply to save some important information.

**UNLIMITED!** Currently you can create **UNLIMITED** annotations with an **UNLIMITED** number of categories/fields in each of them.

### Format of a note
